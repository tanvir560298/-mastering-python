        <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
            Today, I dived deeper into the world of web development, and wow, I’m even more excited about it than before! In 2025, web development is not just important—it’s essential. The internet has become the backbone of how we communicate, learn, and even do business. Every day, we interact with web platforms, often without even realizing how much goes on behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned that web development is like the engine powering the internet. It’s not just about making a website look pretty (although that’s important too!). It’s about creating a seamless experience for users. From designing the look of a website (think fonts, colors, and layout) to making sure everything works smoothly (like buttons, forms, and login systems), web development covers it all. And the best part? Once you create a website or web app, you get to share it with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I found really inspiring today was how documenting my learning process can help me grow. Writing blogs and building a personal portfolio are great ways to track progress. It not only solidifies what I’ve learned but also makes it easier for others—like future employers or collaborators—to see what I can do. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, the journey to becoming a web developer isn’t always easy. It can feel overwhelming at times with so many languages, frameworks, and tools to learn. I’m starting to realize that understanding how the frontend and backend of a site interact can be tricky. And honestly, debugging those annoying errors can be frustrating. But I know it’s all part of the process, and with consistent practice and a focus on real-world projects, these challenges will get easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, I’m focusing on the core basics: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. But the more I learn, the more I realize web development is so much more than that. Tools like Tailwind CSS, React.js for the frontend, and Node.js or Python (Flask/Django) for the backend are key to creating modern web apps. Learning about databases like MySQL or MongoDB, and getting comfortable with Git & GitHub for version control, is also crucial. I also learned how important it is to understand deployment tools like Netlify or Vercel to get my work online.

            What is HTML?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Today, I took my first deep dive into the world of <b>HTML</b>(HyperText Markup Language), and I’m already excited about how fundamental it is to web development. HTMLis the skeleton of any webpage, providing the structure that everything else is built on. Without it, there would be no web content, text, or images—just an empty, lifeless page.
        </p>

            The Building Blocks of HTML
        </h3>
        <p>
            HTML is made up of <b>tags</b> and <b>elements</b> that define the structure of a webpage. Each webpage is a document with a beginning (the <html> tag) and an end, and in between, various other tags tell the browser how to 
        <br>
        display the content. Here’s a simple breakdown:
            <!-- main tags in html -->
        <ul>
            <li>
                &lt;html&gt;: The root element that wraps everything on the webpage.    
            </li>
            <li>
                &lt;head&gt;: Contains metadata like the page's title, links to stylesheets, and other important information.
            </li>
            <li>
                &lt;body&gt;: This is where the visible content of the webpage goes—images, text, links, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>    
        <!-- End of Html -->

        <h2>
            What is a Tag in HTML?

        </h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, a <strong>tag</strong> is the fundamental building block used to define and structure content on a webpage. Tags are essentially instructions for the web browser on how to display the content within them.
            <br>
             Tags are used to create elements that are interpreted by the browser to produce the layout, text, images, forms, links, and everything else you see on a webpage.
         </p>
        <!-- How does tags works -->
        <h3>
            How Do Tags Work?
        </h3>
        <p>
            An HTML tag is made up of the following parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Opening Tag:</b> This is the start of the element, wrapped in angle brackets (< >). For example, &lt;h1&gt; is an opening tag for a heading element.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Content:</b> The content goes between the opening and closing tags. For instance, in the tag &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;, the text “This is a paragraph” is the content.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Closing Tag:</b> This tag closes the element and is also wrapped in angle brackets, but it includes a forward slash (/) before the tag name. For example, </h1> is the closing tag for the heading element.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Ending what is tag -->
        <!-- Starting of elements in html -->
        <h2>
            What is an Element in HTML?

        </h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, an <b>element</b> is a complete set of HTML tags that includes an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. An element is essentially the building block of a webpage, and it defines the structure and content of the webpage. Every piece of content you see on a webpage (text, images, links, etc.) is part of an HTML element.
        <br>
        An HTML element typically consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>An Opening Tag:</b>This tag defines the start of the element.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Content:</b> The content is the information or material between the tags.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>A Closing Tag:</b> This tag marks the end of the element.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>
            HTML Element Structure
        </h3>
        <p>
            Here’s a basic example of an HTML element:
            <br>
            <b>&lt;p&gt; is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;</b>
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Opening Tag: </b>&lt;p&gt;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Content:</b>This is a paragraph of text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Closing Tag:</b> &lt;/p&gt;
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
             In this example, the &lt;p&gt; element is used to define a paragraph. The &lt;p&gt; tag tells the browser that the content inside it should be displayed as a paragraph.
        </p>
    
        <!-- starting of content in html -->
        <h2>
            What is an Content in HTML?
        </h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, <b>content</b> refers to the actual information or material that is displayed on a webpage. This could include text, images, links, forms, videos, and any other data or media that is presented to users. Content is typically placed between HTML tags, which define how that content will be structured and displayed by the browser.

         <p>
            The &lt;head&gt; tag in HTML is used to contain metadata about the HTML document. Metadata refers to information that is not directly displayed on the webpage itself but is important for the browser, search engines, and other services. This includes things like the page's title, links to external resources (such as stylesheets or scripts), and other meta-information that helps define the behavior and appearance of the page.

        <p> 
            <b>Metadata</b> in HTML refers to information about the webpage that isn’t directly visible to the user but provides crucial details to browsers, search engines, and other web services. It helps define things like the page’s title, description, keywords, author, and the character encoding used.

            <li>
                <b>Mobile Optimization:</b> The <mark>&lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;</mark> tag is used to control how your page looks on different devices, especially mobile devices, ensuring that it is responsive and displays well on smaller screens.

            What are Heading Tags in HTML?
        </h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, <strong>Heading</strong> tags are used to define the headings or titles of sections on a webpage. These tags help structure thecontent by breaking it up into different sections with clear headings, which improves both the organization of the page and thereadability for users.
            <br>
            There are six levels of heading tags in HTML, ranging from &lt;h1&gt; <mark>(the most important)</mark> to &lt;h6&gt;
            <mark>(the least important)</mark>. The numbers indicate the level of importance and hierarchy of the heading.

        </h2>
        <p>
        The &lt;p&gt; tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. It’s one of the most commonly used tags in HTML and is crucial for organizing and displaying text content in a readable format.
        <br>
        When you wrap your text inside a &lt;p&gt; tag, the browser automatically formats it with a space before and after the paragraph to distinguish it from other content, making the text more readable and easier to follow.
        </p>
        <!-- Paragrapg tag end -->

        <!-- anchor tag start -->
        <h2>What is the &lt;a&gt; Tag in HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;a&gt; tag, also known as the anchor tag, is used to define hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are clickable links that allow users to navigate from one page to another or to other resources (like images, files, or external websites). The &lt;a&gt; tag is one of the most fundamental and widely used tags in HTML.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Structure of the &lt;a&gt; Tag</h3>
        <p>
            The &lt;a&gt; tag requires the href attribute, which specifies the destination of the link. Here's the basic structure:
        </p>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <td>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>href:</b> This is the Hypertext Reference (URL) that defines where the link will take the user when clicked.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Content:</b> The text or element inside the &lt;a&gt;
                 tag is what will be clickable.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Closing tag:</b> The </a> tag ends the hyperlink

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The target attribute specifies where the linked document will open. The most common values for target are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>_blank:</b> Opens the link in a new tab or window.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>_self:</b> Opens the link in the same window or tab (this is the default behavior).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>_parent:</b> Opens the link in the parent frame (useful in framesets).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>_top:</b> Opens the link in the full body of the window, removing any frames.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <!-- target attribute end -->

            <!-- relation attribute start -->
            <li>
                <h3>
                    <b>rel:</b> Define the Relationship Between the Current and Linked Document
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The rel attribute is often used in combination with the target="_blank" attribute for security purposes. It defines the relationship between the current document and the linked document.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>noopener:</b> Ensures that the new page cannot access the window object of the linking page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>noreferrer:</b> Prevents the browser from sending the referring page’s URL to the server.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <!-- relation attribute end -->

            <li>
                <h3>
                    title: Adds Tooltip Text

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The title attribute is used to add additional information about the link, which will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link.

                </p>
            </li>
            <!-- title attribute end -->

                    download: Download a File
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The download attribute is used to specify that the linked resource should be downloaded instead of being opened in the browser. You can optionally provide a filename for the downloaded file.
                </p>
            </li>
            <!-- download attribute end -->

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The name attribute is used to create a named anchor or bookmark within the page. You could link to specific sections of a page by specifying an anchor point.
                </p>
            </li>
            <!-- name attribute end -->

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The accesskey attribute allows you to specify a keyboard shortcut for activating or focusing on an element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lt;a href="https://www.example.com" accesskey="e"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;

                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can press Alt + E (in most browsers) to activate the link.

        <h2>
            What is the &lt;pre&gt; Tag in HTML?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;pre&gt; tag in HTML stands for preformatted text. It is used to display text exactly as it’s written in the HTML code, preserving all the white spaces, line breaks, and formatting. This is useful when you want to display content that requires specific spacing, such as code snippets, poetry, or text that needs to retain its format.
        </p>
        <!-- ending of pre tag -->

        <!-- starting of br tag -->
         <h2>
            What is the &lt;br&gt; Tag in HTML?
         </h2>
         <p>
            The &lt;br&gt; tag in HTML stands for line break. It is used to insert a line break within text content, forcing the content to start on the next line. This tag is particularly useful when you want to break up text in places where paragraphs are not required, such as within a poem, address, or multiple lines of text.
            <br>
            Unlike other HTML elements, the &lt;br&gt; tag is an empty tag, meaning it does not have a closing tag. It’s self-closing and typically used inside a block-level element (like a &lt;p&gt; or &lt;div&gt;).
         </p>
        <!-- ending of br tag -->

        <!-- Starting of hr tag -->
         <h2>
            What is the &lt;hr&gt; Tag in HTML?
         </h2>
         <p>
            The &lt;hr&gt; tag stands for horizontal rule. It is used to create a horizontal line (or divider) across a webpage. This line is often used to separate content, creating a visual break or division between sections of text or other elements on a page.
         </p>
        <!-- ending of hr tag -->

        <!-- starting of bold tag in html -->
        <h2>
            What is the &lt;b&gt; Tag in HTML?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;b&gt; tag in HTML is used to apply bold formatting to text. It visually boldens the text inside it, making it stand out from the surrounding content.
            <br>
            However, while the &lt;b&gt; tag makes text bold, it is a presentational element—meaning it’s used for styling, and it doesn’t carry any special semantic meaning. This means the text is visually bold, but there’s no extra meaning attached to it for search engines or accessibility tools (like screen readers).
        </p>
        <!-- ending of bold tag in html-->

        <!-- Strong tag in html starting -->
        <h2>
            What is the &lt;strong&gt; Tag in HTML?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;strong&gt;tag is used to indicate that the enclosed text is of strong importance. Unlike the &lt;b&gt; tag, which is purely for visual bolding, the &lt;strong&gt; tag has semantic meaning. It is used to emphasize that a piece of text is important within the context of the document. By default, text wrapped in the &lt;strong&gt; tag is displayed as bold, but its primary purpose is to convey meaning rather than just styling.
        </p>
        <!-- strong tag in html end -->
       

        <!-- italic tag start -->
        <h2>
            What is the &lt;i&gt; Tag in HTML?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;i&gt; tag in HTML is used to display text in <em><b>italic</b></em> style. It is a <b>presentational</b> tag, meaning that its primary purpose is to style text visually by making it italic. However, unlike the &lt;b&gt; tag (which is used for bold text), the
             &lt;i&gt; tag doesn’t carry any special semantic meaning. It simply changes the appearance of the text.
            <br>
            In modern HTML, the &lt;i&gt; tag is used for styling purposes. But, it should not be confused with the &lt;em&gt; (emphasis) tag, which carries semantic meaning and is often displayed as italic as well.
        </p>
        <!-- italic tag end -->
        <!-- emphasis tag start -->
        <h2>
            What is the &lt;em&gt; Tag in HTML?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;em&gt; tag in HTML stands for emphasis. It is used to indicate that the enclosed text should be emphasized, usually by making it <i>italic</i>. However, unlike the &lt;i&gt; tag, the &lt;em&gt; tag carries <b>semantic meaning</b>, meaning it conveys that the content inside it is important or needs to be stressed in some way.
            <br>
            The primary purpose of the &lt;em&gt; tag is to give <b>semantic importance</b> to the enclosed text, and the styling (italicization) is just the default visual representation. The emphasis is more than just a visual cue; it signals to both users and search engines that the text has significance.
